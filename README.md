This project contains a gradle configuration (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`)

Use this command to launch the game :

- `./gradlew run` 

You'll find the game description in `projet.pdf` 
In this project, we have made 2 game modes: Single player normal mode and game mode.
For this, we used an MVC interface and implemented the game in JavaFX.
The 2 implemented modes are complete (time or word limit in normal single player mode and increasing game speed and blue words in single player game mode).
There is a beginning of multiplayer mode (synchronization of windows) but it's not operational.
